Quick proof of concept for http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mikepo/papers/gpukeylogger.eurosec13.pdf

Objective:
- Undetection, our jellyfish rootkit utilized a common LD_PRELOAD technique to hide in userland. For Demon we're going with code
injection.

Disclaimer: 
- We are not associated with the creators of this paper. We only PoC'd what was described in it, plus a little more.

PLEASE READ:
- For some arbitrary reason this project as well as jellyfish, has been getting a decent amount of attention. That being said, we just
want to notify everyone reading this that Demon is not complete nor has even reached the expectations we want it to. We're 
still circling around ideas and pseudo code upon what we think is cool, so apologies to anyone disappointed that they still have
a buggy still-in-beta application. Our goal was to make everyone AWARE that gpu based malware IS REAL; and obviously, telling
from what's been publicized, we succeeded.

Also, to an individual that commented on an arstechnica article about us. Yes, we're very early in development for both projects,
so sit tight and enjoy the show.
